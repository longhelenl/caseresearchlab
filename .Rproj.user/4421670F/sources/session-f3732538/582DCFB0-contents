## About Github
GitHub is a free platform that enables researchers, developers, and organizations to share, collaborate on, and version-control projects online. Originally designed for coding, GitHub is now widely used to **share data, analysis scripts, protocols, and research materials openly**. It supports transparency and reproducibility by allowing users to track changes, collaborate across teams, and publish project repositories for public access. Researchers can use GitHub to make their work more **open, organized, and sustainable.**
