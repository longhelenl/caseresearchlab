## About the OSF
The Open Science Framework (OSF) is a **free, open-source platform** that supports researchers across disciplines in managing, sharing, and storing research projects throughout the entire research lifecycle. OSF allows users to **preregister** studies, **share data** and materials, collaborate with team members, and **make research products openly accessible**. It helps enhance transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration in science. 

Researchers, clinicians, and students can use OSF to organize projects, publish preprints, and connect with open science initiatives worldwide.
