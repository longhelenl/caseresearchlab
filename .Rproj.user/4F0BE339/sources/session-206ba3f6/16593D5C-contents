## Abstract

Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the vocal characteristics of children with cerebral palsy (CP) and anarthria using the stage model of vocal development.

Method: Vocal characteristics of 39 children with CP and anarthria around 4 years of age were analyzed from laboratory-based caregiver--child interactions. Perceptual coding analysis was conducted using the Stark Assessment of Early Vocal Development--Revised to examine vocal complexity, volubility, and consonant diversity.

Results: Children predominately produced vocalizations corresponding to the two earliest stages of vocal development characterized by vowel-like utterances. They showed a limited attainment of consonantal features with low consonant diversity and variably low vocal rates.

Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that underlying neurological impairments resulting in an anarthric status in children with CP affect the progression of speech motor development and their ability to advance beyond early vocal stages. These findings highlight the importance of considering alternative communication modalities for children demonstrating similar vocal characteristics beyond expected periods of development.
