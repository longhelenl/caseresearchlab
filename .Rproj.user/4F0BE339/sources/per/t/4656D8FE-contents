Welcome to the Communication and Speech Emergence Laboratory (CaSE Lab)! We are based in the Communication and Sciences Program in the [Department of Psychological Sciences](https://psychsciences.case.edu/) at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) in Cleveland, Ohio.

The research of the CaSE Lab focuses on the **early identification and intervention** **of** **speech and communication support needs** for infants and young children with motor-based neurodevelopmental disabilities, particularly **cerebral palsy (CP)**.

Our goal is to optimize evaluation and treatment methods for speech-language pathologists (SLPs) to improve clinical support planning for these children and their families and ultimately enhance their long-term quality of life.

Dr. Helen Long, PhD, CCC-SLP directs the CaSE Lab and partners alongside CWRU students, people with disabilities, clinicians, families, disability and clinical translation research networks, and other community members to support young children with or at risk for disabilities.
