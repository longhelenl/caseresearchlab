# Abstract

Purpose: This narrative review explores how the “F-Words for Child Development” framework, a practical translation of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health introduced by Rosenbaum and Gorter (2012), can guide speech-language pathologists (SLPs) in promoting communication and mealtime participation for children with disabilities. 

Background: While the F-Words framework has been widely adopted across rehabilitation disciplines, its application within speech-language pathology remains underexplored. 

Method: The review synthesizes relevant research and conceptual literature organized around each F-Word (i.e., Functioning, Fitness, Family, Friendships, Fun, Future, and Freedom) as a lens for supporting communicative and mealtime participation. 

Conclusion: Findings highlight how SLPs can operationalize the F-Words framework through family-centered care and interdisciplinary collaboration to enhance participation outcomes.
