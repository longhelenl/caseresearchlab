# Abstract

This paper explores how the “F-Words for Child Development” framework, a practical translation of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) introduced by Rosenbaum &amp; Gorter (2012), can be applied by speech-language pathologists to enhance communication and mealtime participation for children with disabilities. Each F-Word is explored as a lens for aligning SLP services with real-world participation in mind. We highlight how SLPs can apply the F-Words through interdisciplinary collaboration and family-centered care while recognizing barriers to implementation.
