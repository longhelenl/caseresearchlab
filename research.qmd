## Research Topics

### üë∂ Early identification of communication support needs
<br /> 

#### üíö Cerebral palsy and speech motor involvement <br /> 
Many children with cerebral palsy (CP) face speech challenges, but these are often recognized too late for early intervention to have the greatest impact.<br /> 

My research focuses on identifying these needs sooner by studying how infants with and at risk for CP use sounds and babbling in the first few years of life. We‚Äôre finding early differences in how speech develops in these children, which may signal future speech and communication support needs.<br /> 

By uncovering which vocal and communication patterns matter most, our goal is to create better tools for early detection of SLP support needs so children with CP can get the care they need as early as possible.<br /> <br /> 

#### ‚àû Autism and other neurodevelopmental disabilities <br /> 
Even before babies say real words, their early vocalizations can offer important clues about how their communication skills are developing.<br /> 

In this area of work, my colleagues and I study how early sounds like cooing and babbling might help us identify other groups of children who are at risk for communication challenges. I‚Äôve worked with research teams studying infants with neurodevelopmental conditions and risk factors such as preterm birth, tuberous sclerosis complex, and autism.<br /> 

Our findings show that these infants often babble less and take longer to produce clear, speech-like sounds compared to typically developing babies. These early differences may signal later challenges in language and social communication.<br /> 

This work is helping us build a foundation for identifying communication differences earlier‚Äîso that children can access support and intervention when it matters most.<br />

### üå≥ Evolutionary origins of language in humans <br /> 

My doctoral research explored how babies learn to make sounds: not just to communicate with others, but also on their own.

By analyzing recordings of infants at home and in the lab, we found that babies often vocalize for themselves, not just socially. In fact, self-directed sounds are more common than social ones. However, when babies do interact with caregivers, they tend to use more advanced, speech-like sounds. Also, we learned that infant vocal imitation is surprisingly rare, but when it occurs, it seems to carry special meaning for language learning.

This work highlights that early speech development is shaped by both internal motivation and social interaction showing the importance of supporting both kinds of vocal experiences during infancy.

### üåê Open science in communication sciences and disorders

This line of my research explores how open science practices, such as making articles freely available (self-archiving), sharing data, and preregistering studies, can increase the accessibility and impact of research in communication sciences and disorders (CSD).

While these practices are becoming more common in other fields, they are still underused in CSD. Through national surveys, we found that many CSD researchers are unfamiliar with open science methods, especially preregistration and open access publishing. However, most are eager to learn and adopt these practices.

We have also found that open access research is cited more often and gains more public visibility. This work underscores the need to reduce barriers and better support researchers in sharing their work openly‚Äîfor the benefit of both professionals and the communities they serve.
