## Biography

I am very interested in learning about speech development, especially during an individual’s early stages of life. I’ve gone through speech therapeutic programs growing up at a young age, and now I want to give back to the community by helping those who may have or are at risk of developing speech difficulties.

I am an undergraduate student majoring in Biology and Nutrition, and also on the pre-PA track. I am the Outreach Chair/External Affairs Executive for Empower Association at CWRU, and am now an undergraduate assistant in the Communication and Speech Emergence (CaSE) Laboratory.

I’m particularly interested in the OBGYN or pediatric side of the pre-health field and would love to work with children. I love playing badminton volleyball with my friends and enjoy rewatching high school slice-of-life anime outside of academics.
