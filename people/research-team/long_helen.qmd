## Teaching 

**COSI 365: Disability and the ICF Framework**<br>
*3 cr, CWRU UGER COSI Program*<br>
This course explores how biological, developmental, social, and environmental factors influence communicative participation in children with neurodevelopmental disabilities, using the WHO's International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) as a central framework.

**COSI 453: Articulation and Phonological Disorders**<br>
*3 cr, CWRU MA SLP Program*<br>
This course explores typical articulatory and phonological development, theoretical models of phonological acquisition, and methods for assessing, diagnosing, and treating developmental speech sound disorders (SSDs), including articulation and phonological impairments.

**COSI 561: Neuromotor and Craniofacial Disorders** <br>
*4 cr, CWRU MA SLP Program*<br>
This course examines congenital and acquired motor speech disorders, including dysarthria, apraxia, and cleft palate. Students explore speech subsystems, underlying neurological and structural causes, and interdisciplinary assessment and treatment approaches across the lifespan.

**COSI 600: Special Topics: Augmentative & Alternative Communication (AAC)**<br>
*2 cr, CWRU MA SLP Program*<br>
This course provides an in-depth exploration of AAC for children and adults with complex communication needs.
