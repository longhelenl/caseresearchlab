Are you a speech-language pathologist with experience providing early intervention services to young children with cerebral palsy?

We’re inviting experienced SLPs to participate in a Delphi Study aiming to identify expert-informed best practices for supporting early communication development in this group of children.

**What’s involved?**

-	Participate in several rounds of information gathering over the next year including:
-	A brief one-to-one interview (30-45 mins) 
-	Subsequent rounds of surveys (approximately 3-4, 15-20 mins each) 

**Who can participate?**

-	Licensed or credentialed **speech-language pathologists**
-	At least 5 years of experience in **early intervention (ages 0-3)**
-	Experience working with children who are at risk for, or diagnosed with, **cerebral palsy**

**Why participate?**

-	You get the opportunity to shape recommendations and contribute your clinical expertise to an area with little existing guidance.
- Clinicians will get access to a set of consensus-based best practices to improve communication-focused intervention for young children with complex motor needs.
-	Compensation is provided with each round of participation.
-	All participants will receive a summary of results.

**Interested?**

Fill out this [brief screening form](https://cwru.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6fZ9Fh4FvK3eYlM ) to continue.
