EdArXiv Preprints.\n\n\nAbstract\nPurpose: The purpose of this qualitative study is to expand upon the findings of Pfeiffer et al.’s (2025) study of the perceptions and experiences of Assistant Professors in Communication Sciences and Disorders (CSD) related to open science (OS) by examining those of Associate and Full Professors.\nMethod: Thirty-one faculty in CSD (15 Associate Professors and 16 Full Professors) each participated in one 1-hour virtual focus group conducted via Zoom videoconferencing software. The researchers used both deductive and inductive coding methods to analyze the focus group data and develop categories and subcategories summarizing the discussions.\nResults: The researchers developed five categories to summarize the focus group discussions: (1) a desire to learn more about various OS practices and how to implement them by learning with and from others through a variety of formats; (2) OS practices have the potential to positively impact their research process and products, their careers, and the research communities they serve (e.g., clinicians, clinical populations); (3) OS practices could enhance the quality and credibility of research in CSD and reduce the research-to-practice gap by engaging both clinicians and researchers; (4) identification of both individual-level and systemic-level factors that could act as barriers or serve as facilitators to their use of OS practices; and (5) recommendations for a cultural shift to reduce barriers to engage in OS practices in CSD.\nConclusions: Associate and Full Professors in CSD perceive many of the same barriers and facilitators to engaging in open science as Assistant Professors; however, they uniquely highlighted the need for a cultural shift from the ways they were trained to enhance implementation of OS practices. This shift includes embedding education about OS early in academic training, clearly outlining benefits and incentives for engaging in OS, and providing opportunities for clinicians to partner with researchers in learning about and implementing these practices."

Canonical babbling development in infancy: A systematic review and meta-analysis of methodological and ambient language influences. OSFPreprints. https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/8ub2v_v1\n\n\nAbstract\nCanonical babbling, or the production of adult-like consonant-vowel syllables in infancy, represents a critical milestone in pre-linguistic vocal development and predicts later speech and language outcomes. This systematic review and meta-analysis synthesized findings from 43 studies and 1,291 infants aged 5-24 months across 16 language environments to examine how methodological and contextual factors influence the most common measure of canonical babbling: the canonical babbling ratio (CBR). Results confirmed a robust, linear increase in CBR with age, reinforcing its role as a consistent developmental marker. Different CBR measures yielded comparable developmental trajectories. Sampling method significantly affected CBR values, with interactive free play sessions eliciting higher CBRs than naturalistic home recordings, particularly in older infants. In contrast, the location of data collection had no effect. Ambient language complexity also shaped CBR: infants acquiring languages with more complex syllable structures (e.g., English, Dutch) initially exhibited lower CBRs compared to infants acquiring languages with less complex syllable structures (e.g., Mandarin, Spanish). Despite these initial differences, babbling trajectories were predicted to converge by approximately 21 months as infants exposed to languages with more complex syllables demonstrated accelerated CBR growth. Publication bias was detected, with smaller samples more likely to report inflated CBRs. To address this issue, simulation-based analyses are reported to estimate sample size recommendations for improved precision in future research. Together, these results support CBR as a meaningful developmental marker while offering practical guidance for future research directions and continued clinical applications."

Foundations of vocal category development in autistic infants. Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-024-06267-9\n\n\nAbstract\nThe present study compared the infant’s tendency in the first year of life to produce clusters of particular vocal types (squeals, vocants, and growls) in typically developing (TD) and autistic infants. Vocal clustering provides evidence of vocal category formation and may establish a foundation for speech development. Specifically, we compared the extent of vocal clustering across outcome groups and age groups. We also examined the associations between the extent of vocal clustering and later outcomes at 2 years within the autistic group. Randomly selected 5-min segments (27,153 5-min segments total) from 1293 all-day home recordings from 103 TD infants and 44 autistic infants across the first year were humancoded (about 9.75 h of data coded per infant on average) to derive vocal clustering patterns. Fisher’s exact tests were used to compare the occurrence of squeals versus vocants, as well as growls versus vocants, across coded segments. Infants in both groups demonstrated clear clustering patterns of squeals and growls across all age groups. The extent of vocal clustering in the autistic group did not correlate significantly with later language, repetitive behavior, or autism severity outcomes. These findings highlight the robustness of the systematic production of vocal categories across the first year of life. The similarity of the clustering patterns in the TD and autistic groups suggests that vocal category formation through active infant vocal exploration is a robust feature of early speech development."

Previous reports suggested delayed or reduced canonical babbling in infants later diagnosed with autism, but the story may be complicated. We present a prospective study on 44 infants later diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder compared with 127 infants later identified as typically developing who were followed longitudinally with day-long recordings from 0 to 13 months. Eight 5-min segments from each of their recordings were coded for canonical and noncanonical syllables. The results confirmed many reports that canonical babbling is a robust feature of human vocal development in the first year of life, with small overall mean differences in canonical babbling rates between the autism spectrum disorder and typically developing groups beginning around 9 months, primarily in males. Our findings highlight the importance of considering sex differences in vocal communication as part of the early detection and diagnosis of autism when determining the need for communication supports to maximize outcomes."

Studies measured prelinguistic vocal characteristics of infants under 24 months with birth risk or genetic conditions known to commonly present with speech motor involvement. Fifty-five studies met criteria for Part 1. Eleven studies met criteria for synthesis in Part 2.\nResults: A smaller percentage of studies examined infants with or at risk for CP compared to studies examining genetic conditions such as Down syndrome. The median year of publication was 1999, with a median sample size of nine participants. Most studies were conducted in laboratory settings and used human coding of vocalizations produced during caregiver–child interactions. Substantial methodological differences were noted across all studies. A small number of high-quality studies of infants with or at risk for CP revealed high rates of marginal babbling, low rates of canonical babbling, and limited consonant diversity under 24 months. Mixed findings were noted across studies of general birth risk factors.\nConclusions: There is limited evidence available to support the early detection of speech motor involvement. Large methodological differences currently impact the ability to synthesize findings across studies. There is a critical need to conduct longitudinal research with larger sample sizes and advanced, modern technologies to detect vocal precursors of speech impairment to support the accurate diagnosis and prognosis of speech development in infants with CP and other clinical populations."

American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology, 32(4S), 1835–1849. https://doi.org/10.1044/2022_AJSLP-22-00165\n\n\nAbstract\nPurpose: This study is a preliminary quantification and characterization of the development of marginal and canonical syllable patterns in 10 infants at risk for cerebral palsy (CP).\nMethod: We calculated marginal and canonical babbling ratios from parentinfant laboratory recordings of 10 infants at two time points, approximately 13 and 16 months of age. The frequency and diversity of labial, coronal, and velar types of marginal and canonical syllables were also examined. Differences across three outcome groups were compared: infants later diagnosed with CP (n = 3, CP group), risk of CP due to ongoing gross motor delays (n = 4, risk group), and current typically developing status with resolved gross motor delays (n = 3, TDx group). Performance on the Mullen Scales was included for perspective on cognitive development.\nResults: Higher marginal syllable ratios were observed in the CP and risk groups than the TDx group. An increasing canonical syllable ratio across the two ages was consistently observed in the TDx group. The TDx group produced a greater frequency and diversity of canonical syllable types than the risk and CP groups, and of marginal syllable types than the CP group.\nConclusions: This study offers preliminary support for the possibility that speech motor impairment in infants with CP have the potential to be observed and quantified early in vocal development prior to the expected onset of first words. Prolonged rates of marginal syllable forms may be suggestive of speech motor impairment; however, additional longitudinal outcome data over a longer time course and a larger sample of infants are needed to provide further support for this possibility."

Although these practices have garnered interest in related fields, it remains unclear whether open science practices have been adopted in the field of communication sciences and disorders (CSD). This study aimed to survey the knowledge, implementation, and perceived benefits and barriers of open science practices in CSD.\nMethod: An online survey was disseminated to researchers in the United States actively engaged in CSD research. Four-core open science practices were examined: preregistration, self-archiving, gold open access, and open data. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and regression models.\nResults: Two hundred twenty-two participants met the inclusion criteria. Most participants were doctoral students (38%) or assistant professors (24%) at R1 institutions (58%). Participants reported low knowledge of preregistration and gold open access. There was, however, a high level of desire to learn more for all practices. Implementation of open science practices was also low, most notably for preregistration, gold open access, and open data (&lt; 25%). Predictors of knowledge and participation, as well as perceived barriers to implementation, are discussed.\nConclusion: Although participation in open science appears low in the field of CSD, participants expressed a strong desire to learn more in order to engage in these practices in the future."

PLOS ONE, 17(12), e0279395. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0279395\n\n\nAbstract\nA growing body of research emphasizes both endogenous and social motivations in human vocal development. Our own efforts seek to establish an evolutionary and developmental perspective on the existence and usage of speech-like vocalizations (“protophones”) in the first year of life. We evaluated the relative occurrence of protophones in 40 typically developing infants across the second-half year based on longitudinal all-day recordings. Infants showed strong endogenous motivation to vocalize, producing vastly more protophones during independent vocal exploration and play than during vocal turn taking. Both periods of vocal play and periods of turn-taking corresponded to elevated levels of the most advanced protophones (canonical babbling) relative to periods without vocal play or without turn-taking. Notably, periods of turn taking showed even more canonical babbling than periods of vocal play. We conclude that endogenous motivation drives infants’ tendencies to explore and display a great number of speech-like vocalizations, but that social interaction drives the production of the most speech-like forms. The results inform our previously published proposal that the human infant has been naturally selected to explore protophone production and that the exploratory inclination in our hominin ancestors formed a foundation for language."

Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 376(1836), 20200255. https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2020.0255\n\n\nAbstract\nHuman infant vocalization is viewed as a critical foundation for vocal learning and language. All apes share distress sounds (shrieks and cries) and laughter. Another vocal type, speech-like sounds, common in human infants, is rare but not absent in other apes. These three vocal types form a basis for especially informative cross-species comparisons. To make such comparisons possible we need empirical research documenting the frequency of occurrence of all three. The present work provides a comprehensive portrayal of these three vocal types in the human infant from longitudinal research in various circumstances of recording. Recently, the predominant vocalizations of the human infant have been shown to be speech-like sounds, or ‘protophones’, including both canonical and non-canonical babbling. The research shows that protophones outnumber cries by a factor of at least five based on data from random-sampling of all-day recordings across the first year. The present work expands on the prior reports, showing the protophones vastly outnumber both cry and laughter in both all-day and laboratory recordings in various circumstances. The data provide new evidence of the predominance of protophones in the infant vocal landscape and illuminate their role in human vocal learning and the origin of language.

Using human observers, we analyzed 74 audio-video recordings within a flexible software-based coding environment. During the recordings, infants were engaged in developmental testing. We determined: syllables per minute (volubility), the number of consonant-vowel combinations, such as ‘ba’ (canonical babbling), the canonical babbling ratio (CBR) (canonical syllables/total syllables) and compared the data with 2 groups of typically developing (TD) infants. One comparison group’s data had come from a laboratory setting, while the other’s had come from all-day LENA (Language Environment Analysis) recordings at home.\nResults: Compared to TD infants in laboratory and all-day LENA recordings, entry into the canonical babbling stage was delayed in the majority of infants with TSC, and the canonical babbling ratio was low (TD mean = .346, SE = .19; TSC mean = .117, SE = .023). Volubility level in infants with TSC was less than half that of TD infants (TD mean = 9.82, SE = 5.78; TSC mean = 3.99, SE = 2.16).\nConclusions: Entry into the canonical stage and other precursors of speech development were delayed in infants with TSC and may signal poor language and developmental outcomes. Future studies are planned to assess prediction of language and developmental outcomes using these measures in a larger sample and in more precisely comparable recording circumstances."

Current Biology, 30, R417-429. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2020.03.049\n\n\nAbstract\nFemale humans appear to have an advantage in language, from early childhood through late adulthood, reported to include a larger vocabulary, more complex utterances, greater expressive language, and better verbal and pragmatic language comprehension. Wakeful infants produce ‘protophones’ — precursors to speech that include vowel-like sounds, squeals, and growls — at a rate of four or five utterances per minute, more than five times the rate of crying, throughout the first year. The massive number of protophones is in itself surprising, but equally surprising, given the presumed female language advantage, we found that, in the first year, boys produced 24% more protophones than girls. This sex bias was true of infants either at high risk (HR) or low risk (LR) for autism. Both genetic and cultural factors may be involved in this bias, and additional research is clearly called for to investigate the origins of the strong tendency of infants to produce protophones and the unexpected tendency for boys to do so to a greater extent."

Before trying to determine how referential vocabulary or syntax may have arisen, it is critical to explain how ancient hominins began to produce vocalization flexibly, without binding to emotions or functions. A crucial factor in the vocal communicative split of hominins from the ape background may thus have been copious, functionally flexible vocalization, starting in infancy and continuing throughout life, long before there were more advanced linguistic features such as referential vocabulary. 2–3 month-old modern human infants produce “protophones”, including at least three types of functionally flexible non-cry precursors to speech rarely reported in other ape infants. But how early in life do protophones actually appear? We report that the most common protophone types emerge abundantly as early as vocalization can be observed in infancy, in preterm infants still in neonatal intensive care. Contrary to the expectation that cries are the predominant vocalizations of infancy, our all-day recordings showed that protophones occurred far more frequently than cries in both preterm and full-term infants. Protophones were not limited to interactive circumstances, but also occurred at high rates when infants were alone, indicating an endogenous inclination to vocalize exploratorily, perhaps the most fundamental capacity underlying vocal language."

    "text": "Dr. Long served as research mentor to five summer scholars in intensive research experience\nThis summer, Dr. Helen Long served as a research mentor to five Summer Scholars through the University Hospitals Health Services Research Center (HSRC) Summer Scholar Program. Her mentees represented a diverse range of training levels—from high school to medical school—and engaged in projects focused on improving healthcare delivery and communication outcomes for individuals with complex needs.\nThe six-week program offers intensive exposure to research methods, mentorship, and professional development, equipping students with the skills and inspiration to pursue careers in medicine and health services research. Under Dr. Long’s guidance, the scholars gained hands-on experience designing and interpreting research in their independent research projects surrounding the early identification and intervention of communication support needs for young children with or at risk for cerebral palsy. All students presented their final projects at the program’s closing symposium to their fellow scholars, mentors, and families.\n“I was honored to mentor such a dedicated and inquisitive group of emerging scholars,” said Dr. Long. “Their enthusiasm and insight really highlight the importance of investing in the next generation of clinician-scientists.”\nNow in its second year, the HSRC Summer Scholar Program is a cornerstone of University Hospitals’ commitment to education, equity, and translational research, helping to build a pipeline of future healthcare leaders.\nYou can learn more about this exciting program here."

Our goal is to spot early signs of speech and communication challenges so children can get support from speech-language pathologists as early as possible.\nWe are currently recruiting SLPs and families in this research!\n💡 Early Vocal Development in Neurodevelopmental Disabilities\nEven before babies say real words, their sounds can tell us a lot. We work with families of infants with conditions like preterm birth, tuberous sclerosis complex, and autism to understand how early vocal differences may predict future communication needs.\n🗣️ Evolutionary Origins of How We Learn to Talk\nBabies don’t just make sounds to interact. They also practice and play when sounds when alone. Our work has found that these self-directed sounds are common and important. When babies are interacting with parents, they tend to use more advanced babbling sounds. Both types of vocal play help shape speech development.\n🌍 Open Science Practices in Communication Sciences & Disorders (CSD)\nWe work with a group of scientists and clinicians in the discipline of CSD to explore how open science is used to enhance the accessibility, reproducibility, and transparency of research in the field of communication sciences and disorders. Our studies have revealed that most researchers want to use these practices, but need more support and resources to get started.

Frontiers in Psychology, 10, 1340. https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01340\n\n\nAbstract\nThere are many theories surrounding infant imitation; however, there is no research to our knowledge evaluating the reliability of listener perception of vocal imitation in prelinguistic infants. This paper evaluates intra- and inter-rater judgments on the degree of “imitativeness” in utterances of infants below 12 months of age. 18 listeners were presented audio segments selected from naturalistic recordings to represent in each case a parent vocal model followed by an infant utterance ranging from low to high degrees of imitativeness. The naturalistic data suggested vocal imitation occurred rarely across the first year, but strong intra- and inter-rater correlations were found for judgments of imitativeness. Our results suggest salience of the infant’s vocal imitation despite its rare occurrence as well as active perception by listeners of the imitative signal. We discuss infant vocal imitation as a potential signal of well-being as perceived by caregivers."

PLOS ONE, 15(8), e0224956. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0224956\n\n\nAbstract\nResearch on infant vocal development has provided notable insights into vocal interaction with caregivers, elucidating growth in foundations for language through parental elicitation and reaction to vocalizations. A role for infant vocalizations produced endogenously, potentially providing raw material for interaction and a basis for growth in the vocal capacity itself, has received less attention. We report that in laboratory recordings of infants and their parents, the bulk of infant speech-like vocalizations, or “protophones”, were directed toward no one and instead appeared to be generated endogenously, mostly in exploration of vocal abilities. The tendency to predominantly produce protophones without directing them to others occurred both during periods when parents were instructed to interact with their infants and during periods when parents were occupied with an interviewer, with the infants in the room. The results emphasize the infant as an agent in vocal learning, even when not interacting socially and suggest an enhanced perspective on foundations for vocal language."

Infant Behavior and Development, 65, 101648. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.infbeh.2021.101648\n\n\nAbstract\nBoth vocalization and gesture are universal modes of communication and fundamental features of language development. The gestural origins theory proposes that language evolved out of early gestural use. However, evidence reported here suggests vocalization is much more prominent in early human communication than gesture is. To our knowledge no prior research has investigated the rates of emergence of both gesture and vocalization across the first year in human infants. We evaluated the rates of gestures and speech-like vocalizations (protophones) in 10 infants at 4, 7, and 11 months of age using parent-infant laboratory recordings. We found that infant protophones outnumbered gestures substantially at all three ages, ranging from &gt;35 times more protophones than gestures at 3 months, to &gt;2.5 times more protophones than gestures at 11 months. The results suggest vocalization, not gesture, is the predominant mode of communication in human infants in the first year."

Functional communication abilities in youth with cerebral palsy: Association with impairment profiles and school-based therapy goals. Language, Speech, and Hearing Services in Schools, 1–16. https://doi.org/10.1044/2021_LSHSS-21-00064\n\n\nAbstract\nPurpose: The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between functional communication skills, underlying speech, language, and cognitive impairments and school-based speech pathology services in students with cerebral palsy (CP).\nMethod: Thirty-five participants with CP who had Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) were classified according to the Communication Function Classification System (CFCS). Participants completed laboratory assessments of speech, receptive language, executive functioning, and nonverbal cognition. Each participant’s speech and language IEP goals were coded into treatment units and then categorized into seven, mutually exclusive target goal areas. Nonparametric analyses were employed to examine differences among CFCS groups in the number of deficit areas and the number of goal areas from the IEP. Descriptive analyses were used to evaluate the extent to which deficit and goal areas in the IEP co-occurred by CFCS level.\nResults: Those in more involved CFCS levels demonstrated more severe speech, receptive language, and cognitive impairments. However, there were no significant differences in the number of deficit areas across CFCS groups. Regardless of CFCS level, there were no differences in the number of treatment goals specified in the IEP. Literacy was the only goal area addressed across all CFCS levels. Those in the most involved CFCS levels had augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) goals, but those with more moderate restrictions in functional communication who also had markedly reduced speech intelligibility did not typically have speech or AAC goals.\nInterpretation: Individuals with CP across CFCS levels demonstrate variability in underlying deficit profiles, suggesting that measures of both functional communication and of underlying deficits are necessary to provide a complete picture of communication needs. Literacy goals were common across all CFCS levels, but AAC goals were limited to the most severely involved individuals, suggesting that continuing education may be necessary to support speech-language pathologists in developing treatments involving the integration of AAC and speech to foster functional communication at school."

Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology, 64(9), 1096–1105. https://doi.org/10.1111/dmcn.15198\n\n\nAbstract\nAim To examine speech impairment severity classification over time in a longitudinal cohort of children with cerebral palsy (CP).\nMethod: A total of 101 children (58 males, 43 females) between the ages of 4 and 10 years with CP participated in this longitudinal study. Speech severity was rated using the Viking Speech Scale (VSS), a four-level classification rating scale, at 4, 6, 8, and 10 years (age 4 years: mean = 52 months [3 SD]; age 6 years: mean = 75 months [2 SD]; age 8 years: mean = 100 months [4 SD]; age 10 years: mean = 125 months [5 SD]). We used Bayesian mixed-effects ordinal logistic regression to model (1) the extent to which speech severity changed over time and (2) patterns of change across age groups and classification rating group levels.\nResults: VSS ratings decreased (speech severity became less severe) between 4 and 10 years of age. Children who were first classified in VSS levels I, II, or III at age 4 years had a high probability of staying at, or improving to, VSS level I by 10 years. Children who were first classified in VSS level IV at 4 years had a high probability of remaining in VSS level IV at 10 years.\nInterpretation: Early speech performance is highly predictive of later childhood speech abilities. Children with any level of speech impairment at age 4 years should be receiving speech therapy. Those with more severe speech impairments should be introduced to augmentative and alternative communication as soon as possible.\nWhat this paper adds: Children with early Viking Speech Scale (VSS) ratings below level IV have a good prognosis for speech improvement. Children with early VSS level IV ratings are likely to remain at VSS level IV over time. Children did not show worsening of VSS level between the ages of 4 and 10 years."

Developmental Neurorehabilitation, 26(1), 44–51. https://doi.org/10.1080/17518423.2022.2143923\n\n\nAbstract\nThe present work examined canonical babbling ratios longitudinally as a measure of onset and consolida­ tion of canonical babbling in two infants at risk of cerebral palsy (CP) between 5 and 16 months. Ten typically developing infants were included for comparison at 6, 9, 12, and 16–19 months. Canonical babbling ratios (CBRs) were calculated from 5-min segments, and follow-up diagnostic outcomes were collected between 24 and 33 months. The two infants at risk demonstrated low CBR growth trajectories compared to the typical infant group, and slightly different patterns of consolidation. The two infants at risk were later diagnosed with different levels of CP and speech impairment severity. All infants demon­ strated greater variability than expected. Studying canonical babbling and other prelinguistic milestones in this population may inform our perspective of the involvement of the motor system in the vocal domain. Additional implications on the analysis of canonical babbling using all-day home recordings are discussed."

Two linear mixed-effects models tested the effects of OA status on citation counts and altmetric scores of the manuscripts.\nResults: Both Green OA and Gold OA significantly predicted a 2.70 and 5.21 respective increase in citation counts compared with Closed Access manuscripts (p &lt; .001). Gold OA was estimated to predict a 25.7-point significant increase in altmetric scores (p &lt; .001), but Green OA was only marginally significant (p = .68) in predicting a 1.44 increase in altmetric scores relative to Closed Access manuscripts.\nDiscussion: Communication sciences and disorders (CSD) research that is fully open receives more online attention and, overall, more scientific attention than research that is paywalled or available through Green OA methods. Additional research is needed to understand secondary variables affecting these and other scholarly and societal metrics of impact across studies in CSD. Ongoing support and incentives to reduce the inequities of OA publishing are critical for continued scientific advancement."

Perceptual coding analysis was conducted using the Stark Assessment of Early Vocal Development–Revised to examine vocal complexity, volubility, and consonant diversity.\nResults: Children predominately produced vocalizations corresponding to the two earliest stages of vocal development characterized by vowel-like utterances. They showed a limited attainment of consonantal features with low consonant diversity and variably low vocal rates.\nConclusions: Our results demonstrate that underlying neurological impairments resulting in an anarthric status in children with CP affect the progression of speech motor development and their ability to advance beyond early vocal stages. These findings highlight the importance of considering alternative communication modalities for children demonstrating similar vocal characteristics beyond expected periods of development."

Research in Developmental Disabilities, 154(1), 104849. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ridd.2024.104849\n\n\nAbstract\nBackground: We describe acoustic patterns across the five most prominent vocal types in typically developing infants (TD) and compare them with patterns in infants who develop autism (ASD) or a developmental disability (DD) not related to autism. Infant-directed speech (IDS) is a potentially important influence on such vocal acoustic patterns. Both acoustic patterns and effects of IDS are important for understanding the earliest origins of communication disorders.\nAims: To compare duration, pitch and loudness of infant vocalizations for three groups of infants (TD, ASD, DD) in circumstances with high or low amounts of IDS.\nMethods and Procedures: Two five-minute segments from each of 1259 all-day recordings across the first year were coded and acoustically analyzed for three groups of infants (130 TD, 44 ASD, 21 DD). Duration, mean fundamental frequency, and root mean square amplitude were determined for &gt;162,000 infant utterances.\nOutcomes and Results: Cries were longest and loudest, and vowel-like sounds were shortest of the five vocal types in all groups. TD infants showed significant alterations in vocal acoustics during periods of high IDS.\nConclusions and Implications: Strong similarities in acoustic patterns occurred across the three groups, but only the TD group showed significant acoustic effects of IDS."

PLOS ONE, 19(5), e0299140. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0299140\n\n\nAbstract\nNon-random exploration of infant speech-like vocalizations (e.g., squeals, growls, and vowel-like sounds or “vocants”) is pivotal in speech development. This type of vocal exploration, often noticed when infants produce particular vocal types in clusters, serves two crucial purposes: it establishes a foundation for speech because speech requires formation of new vocal categories, and it serves as a basis for vocal signaling of wellness and interaction with caregivers. Despite the significance of clustering, existing research has largely relied on subjective descriptions and anecdotal observations regarding early vocal category formation. In this study, we aim to address this gap by presenting the first large-scale empirical evidence of vocal category exploration and clustering throughout the first year of life. We observed infant vocalizations longitudinally using all-day home recordings from 130 typically developing infants across the entire first year of life. To identify clustering patterns, we conducted Fisher’s exact tests to compare the occurrence of squeals versus vocants, as well as growls versus vocants. We found that across the first year, infants demonstrated clear clustering patterns of squeals and growls, indicating that these categories were not randomly produced, but rather, it seemed, infants actively engaged in practice of these specific categories. The findings lend support to the concept of infants as manifesting active vocal exploration and category formation, a key foundation for vocal language."

The robustness of speech-like vocalization in typically developing infants and autistic infants.

Methods and\nProcedures: Families of 302 infants (110 not yet diagnosed or with other diagnoses) supplied 8.6 all-day recordings across the first year. Trained coders analyzed 21 randomlyselected 5-minute segments per recording, counting speech-like vocalizations, cries, and laughter.\nOutcomes and Results: Infants in all groups (including those with other diagnoses or not yet diagnosed) showed volubility of 4-5 per minute for the first year, but boys showed higher volubility than girls in the TD, ASD, and DD groups. While volubility was relatively stable across the first year for both boy and girl TD infants, volubility fell in both ASD and DD boys, while being more stable for girls.\nConclusions and Implications: Strong similarities in volubility were seen across all groups, but male infants diagnosed with ASD or DD showed falling volubility across the first year, a pattern not seen in TD infants."

Parentese elicits infant speech-like vocalizations in typically developing and autistic infants. Infancy, 30(3), e70022.\n\n\nAbstract\nCaregivers across many cultures modify their speech when interacting with infants or young children. This type of speech, commonly known as “parentese”, is characterized by greater pitch variations, longer duration, and louder volume compared to speech directed to adults. Parentese has been found to facilitate language learning. It has been proposed that parentese may benefit early language development because its exaggerated prosody encourages infants to interact with caregivers. We tested this hypothesis by investigating if parentese temporally elicits infant speech-like vocalization in typically developing (TD) and in autistic infants using sequential analysis. We compared caregiver-child vocal contingencies coded from 847 days-long recordings of 103 TD infants and 44 infants with a confirmed diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) at 3 years. Findings revealed that infants were more likely to produce a speech-like vocalization following an adult utterance directed to them in parentese compared to an adult utterance directed to them in adult register. Additionally, the strength of the sequential association between parentese or adult register and infant speech-like vocalization did not differ across diagnostic groups. These findings support the notion that parentese may facilitate language learning via encouraging infants to respond and interact with their conversation partner."

Most importantly, we focused on who each person is beyond their diagnosis: their personalities, interests, likes and dislikes, and the ways they navigate the world.\nThis discussion helped us deepen our understanding of CP as more than a medical condition–it’s a part of a person’s story, but never the whole story. Students shared takeaways about individuality, communication, and the importance of listening to lived experiences as we continue our work to support people with CP and their families."

A qualitative exploration of General Practice SLPs’ experiences in collaborative service delivery with AAC Specialists. EdArXiv Preprints.\n\n\n\nAbstract\nPurpose: This qualitative study investigated how General Practice SLPs perceive their role and skill in the AAC evaluation process, as well as their objectives and experiences when collaborating with AAC Specialists.\nMethod: Nine General Practice SLPs from school-based and medical settings participated in semi-structed interviews describing their AAC experiences before and after engaging with the AAC Partnership Program, a collaborative service model among AAC Specialists and General Practice SLPs. Transcripts were analyzed using a thematic analysis approach.\nResults: Participants reported seeking support from an AAC Specialist due to limited AAC experience, time constraints, and resource access. Collaborations were viewed as valuable for guiding efficient AAC evaluations, device selection, and skill development. However, participants varied in their interest in becoming independent AAC evaluators. While some sought to build AAC expertise, others preferred continued specialist involvement throughout the AAC process.\nConclusion: Partnerships among AAC Specialists and General Practice SLPs may offer valuable approaches to service delivery to promote equitable access to AAC services across settings. Flexible, scaffolded support offered through collaborative service delivery models allows for variability in team needs and preferences for the level of specialist involvement."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Home\n    Publications\n  \n\n\nPoursoroush, Z., Ramsay, G., Yang, C.-C., Buder, E. H., Bene, E. R., Su, P. L., Yoo, H., Long, H. L., Klaiman, C., Pileggi, M. L., Brane, N., & Oller, D. K. (2025). Timing of Intervals Between Utterances in Typically Developing Infants and Infants Later Diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Brain Sciences, 15(8), 819. https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci15080819\n\n\nAbstract\nBackground: Understanding the origin and natural organization of early infant vocalizations is important for predicting communication and language abilities in later years. The very frequent production of speech-like vocalizations (hereafter “protophones”), occurring largely independently of interaction, is part of this developmental process. Objectives: This study aims to investigate the gap durations (time intervals) between protophones, comparing typically developing (TD) infants and infants later diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in a naturalistic setting where endogenous protophones occur frequently. Additionally, we explore potential age-related variations and sex differences in gap durations. Methods: We analyzed ~1500 five min recording segments from longitudinal all-day home recordings of 147 infants (103 TD infants and 44 autistic infants) during their first year of life. The data included over 90,000 infant protophones. Human coding was employed to ensure maximally accurate timing data. This method included the human judgment of gap durations specified based on time-domain and spectrographic displays. Results and Conclusions: Short gap durations occurred between protophones produced by infants, with a mode between 301 and 400 ms, roughly the length of an infant syllable, across all diagnoses, sex, and age groups. However, we found significant differences in the gap duration distributions between ASD and TD groups when infant-directed speech (IDS) was relatively frequent, as well as across age groups and sexes. The Generalized Linear Modeling (GLM) results confirmed these findings and revealed longer gap durations associated with higher IDS, female sex, older age, and TD diagnosis. Age-related differences and sex differences were highly significant for both diagnosis groups."
