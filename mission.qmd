**Mission**: Our mission is to improve the early identification and intervention for communication support needs in children with motor disabilities through education, outreach, research, and collaborative partnerships with families and professionals.

Core Areas: **Awareness - Education - Research - Support - Outreach**

## Research Objectives

- **Early Identification** <br />
    Partner with multidisciplinary teams to design and validate tools that enhance timely recognition of speech and communication challenges in children with developmental motor conditions.
- **Early Intervention** <br />
    Develop and evaluate responsive, family-guided approaches to strengthen communication development in young children with motor-based needs.
-	**Community Engagement** <br />
    Build partnerships with healthcare providers, educators, community organizations, and families to encourage adoption of effective early support tools and strategies. 

**Vision**: We envision a future where every child with a developmental motor condition receives timely communication support and individualized strategies that foster growth from the earliest stages of life. Caregivers are equipped to navigate services and support their child’s full communication potential in home, school, and community settings.


## Statement of Lab Commitments:


In the CaSE Lab, we are dedicated to:

- **Broad Participation and Lab Involvement** <br />
    Inviting team members, research collaborators, and families from a wide range of life experiences to ensure that our work is relevant and meaningful across varied communities.

- **Respectful Engagement** <br />
    Creating a collaborative environment where each perspective contributes to improving communication outcomes for children with motor challenges.

- **Reducing Gaps in Services** <br />
    Addressing service access gaps by designing tools and strategies that are practical, scalable, and sensitive to differences in life context and background.

- **Open Access and Knowledge Sharing** <br />
    Making our research available to all who may benefit—clinicians, families, educators, researchers—and co-creating resources to help put knowledge into practice, so that more children can thrive from an early age.
