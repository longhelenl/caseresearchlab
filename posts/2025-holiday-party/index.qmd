The CaSE Lab wrapped up the semester with a much-needed holiday study break and it was exactly the reset we all needed during finals week.

We kicked things off with a hot chocolate bar stocked with all the essentials (and plenty of marshmallows). Our spread of tamales, cookies, and snacks kept everyone happily fueled while working through end-of-semester studying. We took time to unwind with coloring sheets as a calming brain break to de-stress before finals.

We also gathering around for games and a chance to connect outside of research and deadlines. It was a fun and relaxing way to celebrate the semester’s accomplishments and to appreciate the community we’ve built in the lab.

Thank you to everyone who came, contributed food, or shared a little joy and humor during a busy week. We’re grateful for each member of the CaSE Lab and excited for everything ahead in the new year.

Happy holidays from all of us at the Communication and Speech Emergence Lab! 🎉☕🧡
