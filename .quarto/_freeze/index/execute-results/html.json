We are based within the \\[Communication and Sciences Program\\] (https://psychsciences.case.edu/graduate/doctor-of-philosophy-program/) of the [Department of Psychological Sciences](https://psychsciences.case.edu/) at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nThe research of the CaSE Lab focuses on the **early identification and intervention** of **speech and communication support needs** for infants and young children with motor-based neurodevelopmental disabilities, particularly **cerebral palsy (CP)**.\n\nOur goal is to [optimize evaluation and treatment methods]{.underline} for speech-language pathologists (SLPs) to improve clinical support planning for these children and their families and ultimately enhance their long-term quality of life.\n\nDr. Helen Long, PhD, CCC-SLP directs the CaSE Lab and partners alongside students at CWRU, clinicians, famillies, local disability and translational research groups, and a range of community members to support young children with or at risk for disabilities.
