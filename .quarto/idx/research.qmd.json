I‚Äôve worked with research teams studying infants with neurodevelopmental conditions and risk factors such as preterm birth, tuberous sclerosis complex, and autism.<br /> \n\nOur findings show that these infants often babble less and take longer to produce clear, speech-like sounds compared to typically developing babies.

In fact, self-directed sounds are more common than social ones. However, when babies do interact with caregivers, they tend to use more advanced, speech-like sounds. Also, we learned that infant vocal imitation is surprisingly rare, but when it occurs, it seems to carry special meaning for language learning.\n\nThis work highlights that early speech development is shaped by both internal motivation and social interaction showing the importance of supporting both kinds of vocal experiences during infancy.\n\n\n![](./img/languageorigins.png){.hero}\n<br /> \n\n### üåê Open science in communication sciences and disorders\n\nThis line of my research explores how open science practices, such as making articles freely available (self-archiving), sharing data, and preregistering studies, can increase the accessibility and impact of research in communication sciences and disorders (CSD).\n\nWhile these practices are becoming more common in other fields, they are still underused in CSD. Through national surveys, we found that many CSD researchers are unfamiliar with open science methods, especially preregistration and open access publishing. However, most are eager to learn and adopt these practices.\n\nWe have also found that open access research is cited more often and gains more public visibility.
