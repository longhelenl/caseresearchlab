The major concepts include:\n\n- The classification of speech sound disorders and theoretical frameworks related to developmental aspects of articulation, phonology, and/or motor control\n- Assessment, diagnosis, and treatment planning for speech sound disorders\n- Linguistic and cultural considerations for clinical care in assessment and treatment\n- Interprofessional care for speech sound disorders in neurodevelopmental conditions\n\n\n## üó® COSI 561: Craniofacial & Neuromotor Anomalies\n\n**COSI Graduate Program, Spring semesters, 4 cr.**\n\nSpeech disorders resulting from neurological and structural conditions acting on the motor speech subsystems throughout the lifespan including cleft palate/lip, dysarthria, and apraxia will be discussed. The speech production system, diseases, and neuropathological conditions that affect motor process and resulting congenital and acquired speech disorders of phonation, articulation, resonance, and prosody will be reviewed. Also covered will be the speech, language and hearing disorders stemming from cleft lip and palate craniofacial disorders. Principles and methods of assessment and treatment within an interdisciplinary rehabilitation team framework will be reviewed for both types of disorders. \n\nPrerequisites: COSI 321 or COSI 421 and COSI 405 or equivalent.\n\n\n## üì± COSI 600: Special Topics: Augmentative & Alternative Communication\n\n**COSI Graduate Program, Fall semesters, 2 cr.**\n\nThis course provides an in-depth exploration of Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) for people with complex communication needs across the lifespan. The course emphasizes dynamic assessment, evidence-based intervention planning, and clinical decision-making for diverse populations, including individuals with developmental and acquired disabilities. Students will critically evaluate AAC tools and strategies, including high- and low-tech systems, within person- and family-centered frameworks. Students will develop competencies in system selection, feature matching, goal development, and implementation across clinical, educational, and community settings through case-based learning, expert guest lectures, hands-on experiences with AAC systems, and collaborative problem-solving. The course integrates current research, policy, and ethical issues impacting AAC access and service delivery. Attention will be given to the roles of interprofessional collaboration, cultural-linguistic considerations, and advocacy to promote communicative participation and autonomy across contexts. \n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## üó£Ô∏è COSI 453: Articulation & Phonological Disorders\n\n**COSI Graduate Program, Fall semesters, 3 cr.**\n\nThis course introduces you to normal patterns of articulatory and phonological development, theoretical frameworks of phonological development, methods of speech sound assessment and differential diagnosis, and treatment of developmental articulation and phonological disorders (also known as Speech Sound Disorders, or SSDs).
