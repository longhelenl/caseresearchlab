Two linear mixed-effects models tested the effects of OA status on citation counts and altmetric scores of the manuscripts.\n\nResults: Both Green OA and Gold OA significantly predicted a 2.70 and 5.21 respective increase in citation counts compared with Closed Access manuscripts (p \\< .001). Gold OA was estimated to predict a 25.7-point significant increase in altmetric scores (p \\< .001), but Green OA was only marginally significant (p = .68) in predicting a 1.44 increase in altmetric scores relative to Closed Access manuscripts.\n\nDiscussion: Communication sciences and disorders (CSD) research that is fully open receives more online attention and, overall, more scientific attention than research that is paywalled or available through Green OA methods. Additional research is needed to understand secondary variables affecting these and other scholarly and societal metrics of impact across studies in CSD. Ongoing support and incentives to reduce the inequities of OA publishing are critical for continued scientific advancement.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{=html}\n<nav aria-label=\"breadcrumb\">\n  <ol class=\"breadcrumb\">\n    <li class=\"breadcrumb-item\"><a href=\"../../index.html\">Home</a></li>\n    <li class=\"breadcrumb-item\"><a href=\"../../publications.html\">Publications</a></li>\n  </ol>\n</nav>\n```\n\n\n> Long, H.
