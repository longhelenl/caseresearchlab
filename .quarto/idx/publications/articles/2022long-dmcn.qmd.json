Speech severity was rated using the Viking Speech Scale (VSS), a four-level classification rating scale, at 4, 6, 8, and 10 years (age 4 years: mean = 52 months \\[3 SD\\]; age 6 years: mean = 75 months \\[2 SD\\]; age 8 years: mean = 100 months \\[4 SD\\]; age 10 years: mean = 125 months \\[5 SD\\]). We used Bayesian mixed-effects ordinal logistic regression to model (1) the extent to which speech severity changed over time and (2) patterns of change across age groups and classification rating group levels.\n\nResults: VSS ratings decreased (speech severity became less severe) between 4 and 10 years of age. Children who were first classified in VSS levels I, II, or III at age 4 years had a high probability of staying at, or improving to, VSS level I by 10 years. Children who were first classified in VSS level IV at 4 years had a high probability of remaining in VSS level IV at 10 years.\n\nInterpretation: Early speech performance is highly predictive of later childhood speech abilities. Children with any level of speech impairment at age 4 years should be receiving speech therapy. Those with more severe speech impairments should be introduced to augmentative and alternative communication as soon as possible.\n\nWhat this paper adds: Children with early Viking Speech Scale (VSS) ratings below level IV have a good prognosis for speech improvement. Children with early VSS level IV ratings are likely to remain at VSS level IV over time. Children did not show worsening of VSS level between the ages of 4 and 10 years.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{=html}\n<nav aria-label=\"breadcrumb\">\n  <ol class=\"breadcrumb\">\n    <li class=\"breadcrumb-item\"><a href=\"../../index.html\">Home</a></li>\n    <li class=\"breadcrumb-item\"><a href=\"../../publications.html\">Publications</a></li>\n    <li class=\"breadcrumb-item active\" aria-current=\"page\">{{< meta title >}}</li>\n  </ol>\n</nav>\n```\n\n## Citation (APA 7)\n\n> Long, H.
